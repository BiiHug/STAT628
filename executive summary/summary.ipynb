    "## 1.Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1 Motivation and thesis statement\n",
    "Body fat percentage as a measure of obesity plays an important role in deciding an individual's health condition. There already exists some useful but inconvenient and costly predictive equations for body fat using body circumference measurements. So the goal of this project is to build a simple, robust, accurate and precise equation to estimate body fat percentage.We build a linear function with 2 variables on this data.  \n",
    "### 1.2 Background information about data\n",
    "The data set is based on 252 men. It contains Bodyfat(%), Density$(gm/cm^{3})$ and 14 body circumference measurements. Gender is important, but for this data set is all men, no gender difference, The average bodyfat for men is 18-24%. Usually Abdomen is an important indicator.\n",
    "## 2.Data cleaning\n",
    "### 2.1 Check Bodyfat records by Siri's equation\n",
    "We use the siri's eqaution provided in data description to check bodyfat records. The following plot shows that the **48**th, **76**th and **96**th, **182**nd observations are obviously not on the line(more obvious if image is larger). First we suspect that this mistake comes from computation, so we compute through the equation and results are 14.4, 14.09, 0.37, -3.61 respectively. It is impossible for a person to have a negative body fat. So it is possible that density is wrongly recorded. Therefore, we have no exact evidence to tell which one is wrong, bodyfat or density? In this case we choose to delete them.\n",

    "### 2.2 'Stick-out' points\n",
    "Then we check if there's any weird observations in each variable. We use the following line chart to show these 248 people's records.\n",
    "![Image](https://github.com/BiiHug/STAT628/blob/master/image/notebook_02.png?raw=true)\n",
    "From this plot, we can see the value of most variables like weight, height, chest and abdomen of the **39**th observation are extremely large. However, the body fat of 39th is just 33.8, quite small in comparison. It is quite unnormal and definitely causes huge influence on the model, so we remove it. For the **42**nd observation, it has extremely short height 29.5 while other variables are in normal range. We suspect that the value of height may be wrongly recorded, so we use the linear relationship between $HEIGHT^2$ with $WEIGHT/ADIPOSITY$ to check it. The 42nd point turns out to be the outlier. So we fit the linear model based on the dataset to recalculate its height.We also do a simple linear regression to see if there is any observation of strong influence, no one seems to be extremely weird."

    "### 3.3 Delete Wrist from the BIC model\n",
    "It is clear that the four models have similar performances. Considered simplicity, we choose the model based on BIC as our basic model. Based on four reasons below we decide to retain Abdomen, Weight and delete Wrist:  \n",
    "1.It is hard to explain the cooperation relationship between Wrist and Abdomen:  \n",
    "(1)We do a single simple regression BODYFAT~ABDOMEN, the R^2 could be around 0.7, which is extremely high for a single variable.    \n",
    "(2)ABDOMEN appears in all four selected models, with large coefficient and broad range at the same time, which shows that Abdomen is absolutely of decisive importance of the whole data set. All the variables are just playing the role of cooperation, adjustment and optimization. However, it is hard to explain the cooperation relationship between Wrist and Abdomen. It is also hard to explain the relationship between Wrist and Bodyfat. Wrist is less informative and intuitively understandable to users.   \n",
    "2.The linear model with variables ABDOMEN+WEIGHT gets relatively larger $R^2$ than the one with ABDOMEN+WRIST.    \n",
    "3.The linear model with variables ABDOMEN+WEIGHT still performed well in CV based on RMSE: 4.09  \n",
    "## 4.Model fitting: inference and interpretation\n",
    "The final model is \n",
    "$$(Body Fat\\%)=-42.45868+0.89817Abdomen-0.12103Weight$$\n",
    "All the coefficients of the model are significant.The associated $p-value$ is less than $2.2*e^{-16}$, the residual standard error is $4.058$ and the adjusted $R^2$ is $0.7174$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.For p-value: Since the p-value is small, we can declare that there is a linear relationship between **abdomen, weight** and **bodyfat%**. However, our conclusion carries a 5% error rate where we may have falsely declared that there is a relationship even though there truly isn't a relationship. Correspondingly, we are 95% confident that the interval  (0.795,1.000) contains the true slope value of variable Abdomen, the interval  (-0.160,-0.082) contains the true slope value of variable Weight.\n",

    "2.The residual standard error is 4.058. It shows the precision of our prediction that our predicted bodyfat is on average 4.058 difference from the original bodyfat. The $R^{2}$ represents the two variables we selected could explain about 72% of all the variation in body fat.    \n",
    "3.Model explanation: Each centimeter of abdomen is associated with a 0.9 increase in bodyfat% among men. Each pound of weight is associated with a 0.12 decrease in bodyfat% among men. In general cases, one's percent body fat is mainly determined by the abdomen circumference. For people with the same abdomen circumference, the heavier people will get a lower percent of body fat for they may have more muscle tissue."

    "### 5.1 Diagnostic plots\n",
    "* **For Residual Plot**: The scatters are randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis and the line is almost straight, so it is appropriate to use linear regression on this data.\n",
    "* **For QQ plot**: the points generally fall on the 45-degree reference line which indicate residuals follows **normality**.\n",
    "* **For Scale-location plot**: points are randomly distributed around the horizontal line, i.e., there is **no homoskedasticity violations**.\n",

    "#### 5.2.1 Normality Assumption\n",
    "$H_0$: The population is not significantly different from the normal distribution. We do shapiro-wilk normality test and get p-value: 0.2092, which is larger than 0.05,we do not reject $H_{0}$, i.e., residual follows **normality**.\n",
    "#### 5.2.2 Multicollinearity Test\n",
    "The variance inflation factor of Abdomen and Weight are 4.166731, which are below 5, i.e., there is **no multicollinearity violations**. \n",
    "#### 5.2.3 Homoscedasticity Test\n",
    "$H_0$:The model has constant error variance. We do Non-constant Variance Score Test and get p-value:0.6135939, which is larger than 0.05, we do not reject $H_{0}$, i.e., model follows **homoskedasticity**.\n",

    "**Example usage:** For a people, his abdomen is 90 cm, weight is 170 lbs, his predicted body fat percentage would be around 17.8%. There is a 95% probability that his body fat is between 9.79% and 25.81%.\n",
